What this filter can do:

- Create downsized images from your existing images.
- Resizing is done at build time so thumbnails are always up to date.
- Resize only images that need to be resized.
- Provides an easy way to embed the image.
- Allow any dimensions you wish.
- The full-size image is preserved.
- Validates images - you'll get an error at build time.

This plugin uses this gem internally:
