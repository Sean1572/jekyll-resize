# Features

What this filter can do:

- Create downsized images from your existing images.
- Resizing is done at _build time_ so thumbnails are always up to date for you automatically.
- Resize only images that need to be resized.
- Handles formats such as JPG, PNG, or WebP.
- Converts to **WebP** format for you (a next-generator optimized compressed image format for the web - 26% smaller than PNG and 25 to 34% smaller than JPEG - [article][]).
- Provides an easy way to embed the image.
- Allow any dimensions you wish.
- The full-size image is preserved.
- Validates images - you'll get an error at build time.
